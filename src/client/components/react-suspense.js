        `React.Suspense` is not implemented in this setup. You can't use it. If
        you do, you will get an error saying it is not implemented (at least as
        far as I know). But in theory you will not need it. You can use the
        `RSC` RCC to achieve same functionality. If I am wrong let me know.
